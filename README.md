Currently, this program is just focused on basic Goal Setting. I believe that the every important music session must start with decent goals to be set, so I wanted to focus on that first.

As is, I fixed the initial hierarchy issues with JFrames and JPanels, and I have to figure out how to make the panels create seperate windows to begin adding and subtracting goals from my goal tracker.
Once the window is done, I can then focus on refining my 'Goal' class into something that is expressed into an objective list like how video games do it.

After that, the program needs to have each goal become a checkbox to eventually possess the capability to be checked off as they are completed.
